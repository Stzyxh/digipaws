            <h2>ðŸ¤¯ Why</h2>
            <p>I am a 16-year-old passionate about innovation and open-source development. I have been coding since I was 10 and have been tinkering and experimenting with technology for as long as I can remember. Over the past few months (since April 2024), I have been dedicated to developing DigiPaws and have been coding it entirely on my phone, investing countless hours into building it.</p>
            <p>However, I have reached a point where I can no longer continue coding DigiPaws due to a lack of funds. Despite this, I am determined to turn my idea into a reality. Currently, I live alone and balancing cooking, school, studies, and coding has become quite expensive and exhausting.</p>
            <p>I am seeking support to cover my school fees, meals, which will allow me to focus on developing this app without any financial burdens. My goal is to raise $400 to continue the further development of DigiPaws.</p>
            <p> I promise to keep digipaws free and open-source forever for the public, if this goal is reached</p>
            <p>Thank you for your support</p>
